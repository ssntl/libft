DESCRIPTION
The memchr() function scans the initial n bytes of the memory area pointed to by
s for the first instance of c.  Both c and the bytes of the memory area  pointed
to by s are interpreted as unsigned char.

The  memrchr()  function  is like the memchr() function, except that it searches
backward from the end of the n bytes pointed to by s instead of forward from the
beginning.
The  rawmemchr() function is similar to memchr(): it assumes (i.e., the program‚Äê
mer knows for certain) that an instance of c lies somewhere in the  memory  area
starting  at  the  location pointed to by s, and so performs an optimized search
for c (i.e., no use of a count argument to limit the range of the  search).   If
an  instance  of  c  is not found, the results are unpredictable.  The following
call is a fast means of locating a string's terminating null byte:

char *p = rawmemchr(s, '\0');

RETURN VALUE
The memchr() and memrchr() functions return a pointer to the  matching  byte  or
NULL if the character does not occur in the given memory area.

The  rawmemchr()  function  returns  a  pointer  to the matching byte, if one is
found.  If no matching byte is found, the result is unspecified.
